tests:
    elim the margin equals compare -- do precise double compares between expected and actual

Prometheus & Grafana

lobstats file:
    timestamp and Coinbase feed sequence num when lobstats regenerated
    inputSource, file, runCount (& current iter), urlEnv, url
    per side: midpoint2's volumeMid and the sum of all top P*V. and maybe total volume and P*V
    last message timestamp & sequence num received from Coinbase
    event counts: snapshot, l2update, heartbeat

determine if its possible for me to miss messages (miss buy/sell changes in l2updates), and therefore do I need to try fetching missed ones by calling their REST API
